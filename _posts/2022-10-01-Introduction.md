## Before we begin.....
Hi!

I believe some introductions are in order. My name is Aditya and I'm your average computer nerd
in a CS degree because it seemed cool. I'm a graduate student at the University of Utah and was
duly informed that having a tech blog is super important right now, so here I am!.

I've started this blog to just ramble about the two ongoing projects I'm working on this Fall. 
The first is a relatively old one, I've been working on this from the start of this year as a
student intern. It should be noted, I'm a very low-key contributor to this project because I can
work on this only a few hours a week. The project is called [SLATE](www.slateci.io) and is
spear-headed by teams of contributors from the University of Utah, University of Chicago and the
University of Michigan. In a nutshell, this is a tool that helps inter-institute research teams 
collaborate easily on shared computing resources, data and instrumentation. and provides 
researchers a federated way of deploying and working on high performance computing resources so 
that more time is spent on knowledge discovery rather than on the technical aspects of shared 
computation and data management.

The other project is, in my opinion, the more exciting one to talk about because it's a solo
project which can only be summed up as useless toy for niche programming nerds. I call this project
W-Esolang and the aim is design a [Compiler Explorer](www.godbolt.org) equivalent for 
[esoteric programming languages](www.esolangs.org). Esoteric languages are programming languages
designed entirely as a joke, intended to have the weirdest syntax and rules. Most of these
languages are actually Turing-complete and can be functionally used for software development
(if you're insane enough).

The next few posts on this page will be essentially two series of blogs running in parellel, and
 each series will talk about my experiences on working on both these projects. I hope you find it
 even mildly enjoyable and stick around for more.
